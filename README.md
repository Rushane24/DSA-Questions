# DSA-Questions
Coding interviews have never been more popular. As the demand for high quality developers increased, coding interviews became tougher and tougher. The questions around Data Structures and Algorithms have been a nemesis for developers all over. There seems to be a problem of too many, when one looks for resources on the internet around these, and most times the resources are not structured. This is the problem that this repository intends to solve, by providing ample of questions that can get you up and ready for your coding interview, as I am preparing for mine myself, I shall keep it updating as I go on.

The Repository would be divided into two sub-folders:-
1)# Geeks for Geeks(GFG) - Problem of the Day Q's
2)# LeetCode Question's This Folder will contain additional folders of individual Topics and Data Structures.
